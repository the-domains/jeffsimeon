# The Failure of StartUp Podcast, and What You Should Really Learn.

> Alex Blumberg set out to do a podcast about the real trials of creating a company. His unfair advantages made Startup Podcast just another startup myth.

I'm a podcast fan. I've been a listener since I got my first iPod in 2005\. Much of what I have listened to has been Alex Blumberg's work including hundreds of hours of his previous shows---[This American Life][0], [Planet Money][1] and now the first season of his new podcast, [StartUp][2]. I'm going to listen to the whole StartUp Podcast series, and I recommend you do too. 

But after the first season I feel as though we should pause and reflect upon his goal and whether or not he achieved it. Blumberg states that he wants to tell us the "real story behind a startup." While the podcast maintains humility, admits flubs and has a great narrative voice, we're led astray from the very first episode. Blumberg has huge advantages over the majority startup founders. Investors call these "Unfair Advantages"---and they are an entrepreneur's super powers.
